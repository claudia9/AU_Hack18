## About Tensorflow
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a python library, which
is good at exactly what the name indicates; orchestrating flows of
tensors (multi-dimensional vector). In order to orchestrate tensors,
one needs to understand three concepts, namely, *tensors*, *graphs*,
and *sessions*. We will cover them conceptually here and in greater
detail in the section about the first (and simpler model) included in
this project.

### Graphs
In Tensorflow, you build a graph, which contains all the information
about how different tensors "interact" with each other. 

### Tensors


### Sessions

## About TensorBoard
[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) is
a
